CCCvelo is a computational framework designed to reconstruct CCC-driven CST dynamics by jointly optimizing a dynamic CCC signaling network and a latent CST clock through a multiscale, nonlinear network kinetics model. CCCvelo can estimated RNA velocity, cell pseudotime, pseudo-temporal dynamics of TGs’ expressions or TFs’ activities, and the cell state-specific multilayer signaling network of CCC.
